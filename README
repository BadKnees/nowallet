This project is a secure Bitcoin brainwallet app that will ultimately be 
meant for desktop and Android platforms. It was inspired by reports of 
incidences of Bitcoin being seized physically at border crossings. 
People need an option for a brainwallet that is secure and easy to use.

It's written in Python and depends on the pycoin and connectrum 
libraries. It uses Electrum servers on the back end, and communicates 
exclusively over Tor. It uses a variant of the 'WarpWallet' technique, 
combining PBKDF2 and scrypt with a salt for key derivation, rather than 
the typical, highly insecure SHA256(passphrase) method that your average 
brainwallet uses. It also implements a full HD wallet compatible with 
BIP32/44. The current working title is Nowallet, as in, "I'm sorry 
officer, I have no wallet!"
