This project is a secure Bitcoin brainwallet app that will ultimately be 
meant for desktop and Android platforms. It was inspired by reports of 
incidences of Bitcoin being seized physically at border crossings. 
People need an option for a brainwallet that is secure and easy to use.

It's written in Python and depends on the pycoin and connectrum 
libraries. It uses Electrum servers on the back end, and communicates 
exclusively over Tor. It uses a variant of the 'WarpWallet' technique 
(https://keybase.io/warp/), combining PBKDF2 and scrypt with a salt 
for key derivation, rather than the typical, highly insecure 
SHA256(passphrase) method that your average brainwallet uses. It also 
implements a full HD wallet compatible with BIP32/44. The current 
working title is Nowallet, as in, "I'm sorry officer, I have no wallet!"

We are currently in a pre-alpha state. All testers must be able to
install dependecies and run from the simple command line interface.


REQUIREMENTS:
Make sure you have Git, Python3.5 (or higher), and pip installed
